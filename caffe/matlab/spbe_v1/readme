Dataset:
To test the code, you should first download the GIST1M dataset from OneDrive:
http://1drv.ms/1HSLPyZ
and change the corresponding path in LoadDataGist.m.
Note the dataset is zero-centered before training and testing.

Example:
You can start from demo.m. The mean averaged precision (mAp, based on k-nn) will be saved in ./results/.
